                                 <p>There are certain braces that apply corrective forces to the leg to take pressure off areas where the arthritis is at its worst. In the past, these tended to be fairly bulky devices, but now there are lightweight, easy-to-use braces such as the Unloader One and Unloader FIT, specifically designed for knee OA and clinically proven to help with the pain. Bracing can also be used in conjunction with other forms of treatment, such as exercise and weight loss programs, injections and physical therapy.</p>

                                <p>Medication is used primarily to control the symptoms of knee OA, especially the pain. There are a number of prescription drugs and common over-the-counter-medicines that can help. These include aspirin-free pain relievers (paracetamol), anti-inflammatory drugs and creams, corticosteroids (steroids may help control inflammation) and sleeping pills.</p>

                                <p>Pain can gradually get worse as the OA progresses, so sometimes stronger drugs are prescribed. However, the long-term nature of OA means that taking stronger medication over a long period of time may lead to unwanted side-effects, something that needs consideration.
                                Injections of hyaluronic acid (found naturally in healthy joints) can also be used to provide temporary relief, while anesthetics with an anti-inflammatory ingredient (commonly cortisone) may help to relieve the pain by numbing the knee. These kinds of injections are well-established treatments, but the results can vary from patient to patient.</p>

                               <p> If you can lose any surplus body weight, you will help to ease the pain because the stress on your knee is reduced. Regular exercise can help to achieve that. It can also improve your strength and flexibility, which will help to increase movement and potentially reduce the pain.
                                It’s important to include joint and muscle exercises, but AVOID high-impact activities that increase the load on your knee as much as possible – climbing lots of stairs for example. Avoid activities that involve twisting or rapid stop/start movements. Try not to kneel down too much, or lift heavy objects. Don’t sit down too often on low chairs or sofas. And if you do have to do any of these things, remember to take a break and give your joints a rest.</p>

                                <p><strong>1. Get a prescription</strong></p>
                                <p>First, you will need to visit your doctor for a confirmed diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis (OA), typically medial or lateral unicompartmental knee OA. It is worth taking, or emailing a copy of the Unloader product page from this website, so that your doctor can check if this treatment is right for your needs.</p>

                                <p><strong>2. Find a practitioner</strong></p>
                                <p>Once you have a prescription for an Unloader brace, you need to contact an orthotist/practitioner in your area who can fit you. Your doctor may have a recommendation or referral. Alternatively, you can find a practitioner using our online facility. It is always advisable to use a qualified practitioner for initial fittings.</p>


                                <p><strong>3. Check costs prior to making a commitment</strong></p>
                                <p>Once you have located a suitable practitioner, have them verify your medical insurance coverage before you make any commitments, so that you are aware of any potential out-of-pocket costs before purchasing the brace.</p>



                               <p> <strong>4. Get fitted properly</strong></p>
                                <p>A good fit is essential for comfort and effective knee OA pain relief. The practitioner will ensure that a) the brace is fitted correctly, and b) you know how to use it to best effect before you leave. It is advisable to bring a pair of shorts to the fitting so that the practitioner can fit the brace correctly. And don’t forget your insurance card.</p>
