                                 There are certain braces that apply corrective forces to the leg to take pressure off areas where the arthritis is at its worst. In the past, these tended to be fairly bulky devices, but now there are lightweight, easy-to-use braces such as the Unloader One and Unloader FIT, specifically designed for knee OA and clinically proven to help with the pain. Bracing can also be used in conjunction with other forms of treatment, such as exercise and weight loss programs, injections and physical therapy.

                                If your doctor thinks that massages and/or exercises may help, they can refer you to a physical therapist, who can work with you on an exercise program tailored to your needs.
                                If you would benefit from things like a higher chair or toilet seat (so you don’t have to bend your knees so much), you may find it useful to talk to an occupational therapist, who will know all about special devices to make home and work life easier and less painful.

                                Medication is used primarily to control the symptoms of knee OA, especially the pain. There are a number of prescription drugs and common over-the-counter-medicines that can help. These include aspirin-free pain relievers (paracetamol), anti-inflammatory drugs and creams, corticosteroids (steroids may help control inflammation) and sleeping pills.

                                Pain can gradually get worse as the OA progresses, so sometimes stronger drugs are prescribed. However, the long-term nature of OA means that taking stronger medication over a long period of time may lead to unwanted side-effects, something that needs consideration.
                                Injections of hyaluronic acid (found naturally in healthy joints) can also be used to provide temporary relief, while anesthetics with an anti-inflammatory ingredient (commonly cortisone) may help to relieve the pain by numbing the knee. These kinds of injections are well-established treatments, but the results can vary from patient to patient.

                                If you can lose any surplus body weight, you will help to ease the pain because the stress on your knee is reduced. Regular exercise can help to achieve that. It can also improve your strength and flexibility, which will help to increase movement and potentially reduce the pain.
                                It’s important to include joint and muscle exercises, but AVOID high-impact activities that increase the load on your knee as much as possible – climbing lots of stairs for example. Avoid activities that involve twisting or rapid stop/start movements. Try not to kneel down too much, or lift heavy objects. Don’t sit down too often on low chairs or sofas. And if you do have to do any of these things, remember to take a break and give your joints a rest.
